# neural-supertagging
HPSG supertagging experiment

See requirements.txt for a few packages that need to be installed. It should be possible do just install pydelphin (and it should install the rest).

To get a copy of the ERG, see https://github.com/delph-in/docs/wiki/ErgTop but to cut to the chase, it lives on SVN:

 $ svn checkout http://svn.delph-in.net/erg/tags/2020

or:

 $ svn checkout http://svn.delph-in.net/erg/trunk
